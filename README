This is early, pre-alpha software.  If you aren't familiar with autotools, 
please wait until binary packages are available.

Successfully built on:
Linux - GCC, LLVM/clang
FreeBSD - GCC
IRIX - MIPSpro (Big-Endian functionality verified)
AIX - xlC, GCC (Big-Endian functionality verified)
Windows - MinGW - Needs rework.  Priority is getting basics working on UNIX.

== Users ==
Ubuntu users can try to compile from the latest source tarball available from this
server: http://bb.tkte.ch/job/craftd-ubuntu/ or use git to download from
git://github.com/kev009/craftd.git.

Keep in mind that this is bleeding edge and may not always be stable or usable.

Ruby and Rake are the suggested way of building craftd, although a statically generated
Makefile and configure script are shipped if you cannot/do not want to install Ruby and Rake.

If you need to compile from the git repo, don't forget to run ./autogen.sh
before heading into configuration/compilation.

Once you have the source prepared you can run rake install OR ./configure, make, and make install.
By default, the server binary is located at /usr/local/bin/craftd.

At the moment craftd does not generate world data for a new server. You will need to
provide world data from another server to start.

== Developers ==
Please contact me and let me know what parts you intend to work on first.

NOTE: You must run ./autogen.sh after checking out the git repo to generate a
configure script and pull the submodules.

Use `git pull` for being up to date. Should you run into build issues, try running
`make distclean` and see if it helps.
